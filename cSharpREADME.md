As a software engineer, I aim to enhance my programming skills and gain practical experience in software development. To further my learning in C#, I developed a To-Do List Manager application. This software allows users to create, view, remove, and mark tasks as completed, providing a simple interface for managing daily tasks.

My primary purpose for writing this software was to solidify my understanding of object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes and inheritance, while also gaining hands-on experience with file handling in C#. This project serves as a practical example of how to apply programming principles in a real-world context, reinforcing my knowledge and skills in software development.

You can view my software demonstration and walkthrough of the code in this video: https://youtu.be/SoI2EzAjQRI.

Development Environment
For developing the To-Do List Manager, I used Microsoft Visual Studio as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This powerful tool provides a comprehensive set of features for writing, debugging, and testing C# applications.

The programming language I used is C#. It is a versatile, modern programming language known for its efficiency in building various applications. I did not use any external libraries for this project, relying solely on the core functionalities provided by C# and the .NET framework.

Useful Websites
Throughout this project, I used a website helpful for enhancing my understanding and solving specific challenges:

Looking ahead, there are several improvements and features I plan to implement in the To-Do List Manager:

User Authentication: Add a login system to personalize user experiences and manage tasks per user.
Task Prioritization: Introduce a feature to set task priorities and sort tasks accordingly.
Graphical User Interface: Develop a GUI version of the application using Windows Forms or WPF for better user interaction.
Mobile Version: Explore options for creating a mobile app version of the task manager to make it accessible on various devices.
Cloud Sync: Implement cloud synchronization to allow users to access their tasks from multiple devices seamlessly.
